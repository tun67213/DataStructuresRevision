# DataStructuresRevision
## Description
    This project is designed to demonstrate the linking between various data structures, and their usage.
    The project will focus on covering the functions for interfaces, and then the functions for the classes themselves.
## Interfaces
The following are the interfaces and the functions they will contain.

### RandomAccess.java, Serializable.java, Cloneable.java
    The three interfaces mentioned above are all empty interfaces, i.e., they contain no functions.
