# DataStructuresRevision 
    This project is designed in a way as to allow users try using the data structures created, and modify them to their preferences.
    By doing so, they will get the chance to test it.
[Main.java] ([#main](https://github.com/tun67213/DataStructuresRevision/blob/main/src/Main.java))
    To run it:
        1) Open main.java (as in the link below) and create a copy of it.
        2) Then, add a statement based on what class you would like to run.
            - i.e. if you want to create an ArrayList of type int, you could do one of the following:
                * List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
                * ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        3) Once done with that, you would simply do "list.'functionName'" to call the function of your liking.
            - As soon as you do 'list.' the compiler will suggest the functions that are available.
        4) After completing all those steps, simply run Main.java.
            - Advice: If you really want to test out THIS repository, do NOT import modules for files that exist here, as they will ignore the implementation in this repository.
