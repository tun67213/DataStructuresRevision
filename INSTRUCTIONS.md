# DataStructuresRevision 
    This project is designed in a way as to allow users try using the data structures created, and modify them to their preferences.
    By doing so, they will get the chance to test it.

# Instructions for Running the Project

Follow these steps to run the project and test the data structures in this repository:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Navigate to the [DataStructuresRevision repository](https://github.com/tun67213/DataStructuresRevision) on GitHub.
   - Click on the **Code** button and copy the repository URL.
   - Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/tun67213/DataStructuresRevision.git
     ```

2. **Open the Project:**
   - Open the cloned project in your preferred IDE (such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).
   - Navigate to the `src` directory and open `Main.java`.

3. **Modify the `Main.java` File:**
   - To run a specific data structure, add the appropriate statement in `Main.java`.
   - For example, if you want to create an `ArrayList` of type `Integer`, you can add one of the following lines:
   
     ```java
     List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
     // OR
     ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
     ```

4. **Call Functions:**
   - Once the list is created, you can call the functions associated with the `ArrayList` by using:

     ```java
     list.functionName();  // Replace 'functionName' with the desired method
     ```

   - The IDE will provide suggestions for available methods once you type `list.`.

5. **Run the Program:**
   - After making your changes, simply run `Main.java` from your IDE.
   - **Note:** Do **NOT** import modules for files that already exist in this repository, as it will override the custom implementations.

6. **Test the Custom Data Structures:**
   - This project is designed to let you test and modify the provided data structures. Feel free to experiment and adapt them to your needs.
